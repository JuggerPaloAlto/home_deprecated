                    <h2>How to Hit People</h2>
                    <p>
                        90% of the game is commiting violence against the opposing team, using foam weapons.
                        Here, you can see in green what counts as a hit and what doesn't:<br>
                        <img src="img/hitzones.jpg"> <img src="img/pplhitzones.jpg"><br>
                        Note that getting hit with pommels, the middle of the staff, shields, or rope does NOT count
                        (for safety and fairness reasons).
                        Additionally, head and neck shots do NOT count (to encourage safer play), and hands don't either
                        (mostly to keep the game more fun).<br><br>
                        There is one final weird deal with the chain: if the ball is "wrapped," which means it has spun
                        around a weapon 360 degrees, then
                        the ball is not "live", which means getting hit with a "wrapped" ball does not count. A wrap:
                        <br>
                        <img src="img/wrap.jpg"><br>
                        Stick weapons wrapping the ball are still "live", except in Arizona, because the folk there do
                        their own thing. Obviously, don't continue running around with the wrapped stick
                        if the chain is, for example, also wrapped around someone's neck (again, don't be reckless when
                        you play!)

                    <h2>Full Game Summary</h2>
                    <p>
                        Full games are played by two teams of 5. They play on a field of 40m x 20m.
                        4 "enforcers" can choose a weapon (note there is a limit of 1 chain per team), and 1 "quick"
                        will be unarmed. <br>
                        The objective - get the center ball (also called skull or jug) and outscore the other team before the game ends.

                        
                        
                        ends.</p>

                    <p>
                        If you ever decide to go to a tournament, you are allowed to have the following number of people
                        on your team:<br>
                        5 to 8 (Arizona)<br>
                        5 to 10 (Colorado)<br>
                        Any other location, you should consult the organizers. If you go above this number, you will have to 
                        split up your team, or some people can't play!
